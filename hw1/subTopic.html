        <p> Ren'py is a free open source tool used to make more visual interactive text experience. It differes from others because a large part of the experience is showing a background image along with character images instead of being just a text only experience. This software tool has become popular enough to have a large user base. Many visual novels using renpy can be found on a visual novel site called itchio. Ren'py is also very flexible in the platforms it can run on. Currently it can run on android phones, ios phones, windows, linux and mac os. It has html support so it can run on the browser if coded to do so. It barely needs basic python scripting for a user to make a visual novel. The website has a tutorial to get started on making it.</p>
        <p>Ren'py was made using python.</p>
